                    <p class="intro_text">      Computer and video gaming are a billion dollar industry, and it’s made up of a variety of people. The average gamer is 35, and the majority of gamers are over the age of 18. Although it’s a popular pastime — everyone knows someone who is a gamer, it seems — there are still a lot of misconceptions about the people who play computer and video games. For instance, many believe that gaming is entirely male-dominated.
