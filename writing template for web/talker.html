                    <p class="blog-post-meta">oct,1 2016 by <a href="#">Wei Tang</a></p>
                    A couple days after the Women’s March on Washington, the Trump administration introduced a bill, H.R.7 that will hinder women’s access to federal financial assistance for abortions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/bills/hr7/BILLS-115hr7ih.pdf">H.R.7</a>bill, known technically as the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act of 2017, has passed in the House, but in order for the bill to become law, it needs to be approved by the Senate. For it to pass in the Senate, 60 votes in favor are required. There are 52 Republicans in the Senate.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/142/text">The Hyde Amendment </a>, a former version of H.R.7, bans federal funding of abortion. However, this is not a permanent law and must be renewed every year.

                    </p>

                    <div>
                        <img class="img-left"  src=" images/hr7.png" width="1000" height="600"/>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Hyde Amendment makes exceptions for women who are victims of rape or who medically require abortions to save their lives. H.R.7 includes the same exceptions.</p>

                    <p> If H.R.7 becomes a permanent law, millions of women will be left with fewer choices for affordable abortions.</p>

                    <p>  <a href="https://law.yale.edu/centers-workshops/gruber-program-global-justice-and-womens-rights/about-us">Mindy Roseman</a>, the director of the Gruber Program for Global Justice and Women’s Rights at Yale Law School, claims that H.R.7 is penalizing women who need federal assistance to get an abortion.</p>

                    </p>
                    <hr>



                    <p>
                        “It's already been not affordable for lower income women. If they cannot use U.S. federal dollars, their states provide subsidies to cover abortions. Or, they can get the donations from people,” Roseman said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        She believes that even if this bill becomes law, it is not going to change anything that has already been established in the years the Hyde Amendment was renewed.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                    “All it does just make it permanent,” Roseman said. She believes that this bill won't prevent women from getting an abortion.

                    </p>

                    <p>

                        H.R.7 has been pushed through the White House quickly, and for Roseman, that is not a surprise, even after thousands of women marched in Washington, D.C.
                    </p>

                      <p>
                          “There are lots of easy wins, and abortion is always one of those issues. The Republicans get a lot of popularity and show that they can follow through that way. It’s at the top of their agendas,” Roseman said.
                      </p>
                    <P>
                    Roseman does hope that the bill doesn’t become a law, and she thinks it’s possible, but that all depends on the Senate.
                    </P>

                    For Georgette Forney, president of Anglicans for Life, the abortion she had at age 16 later caused negative impacts both physically and emotionally.
                      </P>
                    <P>
                        “That’s the reason I’m here. I use my own experience to persuade people who support abortion,” she said.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Forney said the H.R.7 bill is just the start of making abortion illegal.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        She believes that although this bill focuses on defunding from taxpayers, it doesn’t go far enough.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        Forney believes that if H.R.7 becomes law, it may affect only some lower-income women, but it cannot prevent the majority of women from getting abortions because the procedure costs about $400 to $700.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Anglicans for Life is a pro-life organization based in Pennsylvania. They advocate against abortion and euthanasia.
                    </p>
                        Forney also believes that scarce tax dollars could be used to help women in full-service medical centers — like community health centers — where all their needs can be met. She believes that all women deserve high-quality care from medical professionals who can meet all their needs.
                        <P>
                        Forney is against the idea that women can choose to abort or not.
                        </P>
                     <p>
                    She believes the decision “involves two people, you and your child.” Forney thinks that women who choose abortions are making decisions without asking their babies.
                     </p>
                    <P>
                        Roseman of the Yale Law School disagrees.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        “I think it’s silly to think about asking a baby’s opinion,” Roseman said. She thinks that separating the unborn child from women is wrong thinking.
                    </P>
                    <p>
                        Roseman believes that to keep abortion accessible, all of the federal law needs to be opposed through either counter-legislative efforts, through lawsuits, and through community activities, whether at the state level or private.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “It’s not about moral decay but about helping people make decisions about their own lives,” Roseman said.
