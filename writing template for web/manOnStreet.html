                    <span class="dropcap">A</span>t the beginning of 2017, albeit with some  hesitate，Bostonians are optimistic about the new year.
                        Eight of 10 strangers on the street said they are feeling hopeful about 2017, and 20 percent said they’re anxious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “I feel hopeful about this new year because I believe our governmental system.” Adriana Yozzi said, an undergraduate student from Northeastern University.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She believed that President-elect Donald J Trump wouldn’t get as much power as almost of American citizens are thinking. Also, Yozzi thought that Trump should have someone monitor his social media better, in case that some informal opinions on his twitter are likely to bring some trouble to the foreign affairs.

                    </p>



                    <p>
                        Raymond Don Carignan, a retired high school teacher, held optimistic attitude about Trump in 2017. “Let’s give him a chance.” Carignan said.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Carignan claimed that although he voted for Hillary Clinton because he is a Democrats, he support Trump more in his mind. “I was glad that Trump got the business”. Carignan said.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Carignan thinks that Trump has an established policy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                            Moreover, Raymond thought that Trump on last December officially selected Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, to be the secretary of state ,which is a smart choice.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                        “He(Tillerson) sees something in the front, which is good for the nation.” Raymond said.

                    </p>

                 <p>
                     “I did vote for trump.” Said by Adam McCarthy, a chef working in No.9 Park in Boston. The reason why he voted for trump is because his parents own a small business and he likes The Trump’s small business policy which is lowering the income tax to 15 percent.
                 </p>

                     However, he pointed out that he disagreed with Trump’s immigrant policy that the H1-B is likely to be canceled under Trump’s presidency. He believed that every foreigner in America should have an opportunity to work, rather than being rejected.

                    <P>
                     Jim kituum, a student from Northeastern University. “I forced myself to be hopeful that he will help everyone get a job for sake.” Kituum said. But he did feel hopeful for the economy in 2017. He pointed out that Trump will be surrounded himself with smart enough people who are going to make a right decision.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                        Bob Smith, a police officer, thought 2017 will be better than 2016. “Yes, I do feel hopeful about 2017.” Smith said. He thought that Trump will be the President of United States so that Trump acts as the captain and we all need to get behind him, helping him to achieve the goal which is for the country to do better.</P>
                    <p>
                        He reported that he strongly support with the law enforcement policy which Trump brings. “I do support it which I do for living.”
                     </p>
                    <p>
                     When asked about the possibly dangerous outlook in foreign affairs, Smith didn’t think Trump’s twitter will bring any trouble. “Politician say one thing, and it really means something else.” Smith said. He thought that this is the way that Trump has being trying to get attention.
                    </p>
                     <p>
                    However, some people, are still worry about what will happen next.
                     </p>

                    <P>
                     Gil Stone, a security guard, felt hopeless about 2017. “He is a big bully and he couldn’t be a president if he is a bully.”  Stone said. Also Stone concerned about the foreign affairs, because United States has elected a president who is so friendly with Russia and its President, Vladimir Putin.
                    </P>
                    <P>
                     Jeanine Martin, a nurse and Christian, said she is anxious about 2017. “I find my hope from the Bible”. Martin said. She said she didn’t trust and support Trump at all.
                    </P>
                     <P>
                         Stevona Singleton, a front desk at anton's cleaners, felt precautious about the inauguration of this new president.
                     </P>
                    <P>
                    Singleton said she was afraid of the decisions which Trump has been trying to put through, especially for women.  Some women are worried about the birth control issue under presidency of Trump. “Everyone should have their own right to do something on their own bodys.” Singleton said.
                     </P>
